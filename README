-----> WHAT ?

Kanatest is a Japanese kana (Hiragana and Katakana) simple flashcard tool.
You can learn, or remind yourself about kana chars in quick and easy way!

List of key features:

    * Fifteen lessons (groups of kana chars)
    * Lesson can be fully customizable by user
    * Repeating wrongly-answered questions mode
    * Built-in kana chart
    * Advanced statistics

During test the Kanatest displays randomly selected kana char (respecting
mode and lesson) and waits for user answer expected as romaji equivalent.
This process continues until all questions will be answered or all questions
will be answered correctly (depends on options). At the end of test a short
info about drilling time and correctness ratio is displayed.
The results are stored and user can review his performance in any time.
