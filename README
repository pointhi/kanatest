During test the Kanatest displays randomly selected kana char (respecting
mode and lesson) and waits for user answer expected as romaji equivalent.
This process continues until all questions will be answered or all questions
will be answered correctly (depends on options). At the end of test a short
info about drilling time and correctness ratio is displayed. 
The results are stored and user can review his performance in any time.

List of key features:

    * Fifteen lessons (groups of kana chars)
    * Lesson can be fully customizable by user
    * Repeating wrongly-answered questions mode
    * Built-in kana chart
    * A number of correct and incorrect answers, correctness ratio, date 
      and time of test, lesson type are stored between program sessions 
      and can be viewed in statistics window.
    * Colors and kana font are configurable
